title: Resume a Flux Kustomization
intent: flux-resume
resource: kustomization
risk_level: low

preconditions:
  - Kustomization must exist and be suspended
  - User has edit permissions for flux-system namespace

command_template: "flux resume kustomization {{name}}"

flags: []

examples:
  - goal: Resume reconciliation after maintenance
    render:
      command: flux resume kustomization heatpump-settings
      checks:
        - flux get kustomizations heatpump-settings
        - Verify SUSPENDED column shows False
        - flux reconcile kustomization heatpump-settings

  - goal: Resume and immediately reconcile
    render:
      command: flux resume kustomization apps && flux reconcile kustomization apps
      checks:
        - flux get kustomizations
        - kubectl get pods --all-namespaces

postprocess:
  summarize_to_json: false

notes:
  - Restores automatic reconciliation of the Kustomization
  - FluxCD will immediately check for drift and reconcile
  - Use after completing maintenance or debugging
  - Safe to resume - will only apply declarative configs
  - Consider running flux reconcile after resume for immediate sync
