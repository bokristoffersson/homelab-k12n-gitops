# For local development, we need to be selective about what we include
# HelmRelease requires Flux controllers to actually work
# For now, skip Redpanda in local development - use Mosquitto for MQTT testing

resources:
  - ../../base/redpanda-v2/namespace.yaml
  # Skip HelmRelease - requires Flux controllers
  # Skip topics - requires Redpanda operator CRDs

# Note: To run Redpanda locally, either:
# 1. Install Flux controllers (defeats the purpose of local dev)
# 2. Deploy Redpanda using helm CLI directly
# 3. Just use Mosquitto for MQTT testing (recommended)
#
# For MQTT testing: MQTT Generator → Mosquitto → mqtt-subscribe
# You don't need Redpanda to test the MQTT generator!
